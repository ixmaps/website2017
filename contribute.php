    <h2>Contributing to the IXmaps database anonymously</h2>
    <p>IXmaps relies on voluntary contributions of anonymized traceroute data. We invite you to join over 1000 other contributors who have helped to grow the database to well over 500,000 traceroutes. The more distinct the originating points, in terms of both city and ISP, and the more varied the destination targets, the better able we are to display interesting internet routings.</p>

    <p>Contributing data involves installing traceroute generating software built by the IXmaps development team. It initiates traceroute requests from your location either at batches of pre-selected target sites, or at individual hostnames (like URLs) of your choosing. You can view the traceroutes you and others have contributed via the <a href="map.php" class="link">Map page.</a></p>

    <p>To ensure the anonymity of contributors, we do not store the IP address of your personal device, but only a truncated version, with the last quad zeroed out. eg. 127.123.123.0. To verify this and any other features of this software, check out our free and open source code on <a href="https://github.com/ixmaps/IXmapsClient">GitHub</a>.</p>

    <p>You should be aware that in order to work effectively, the traceroute generation software needs access to low-level (e.g. "socket layer") functions of your computer. Read carefully the ReadMe document that comes with the download package before installing and running the software. See our Privacy page, for more on how we anonymize your IP address and protect your privacy.</p>

    <h3>Update</h3>
    <p>As of August 30th, 2020, IXmapsClient version 1.0.6 will no longer function correctly. Please download IXmapsClient 1.1.1 to continue to contribute to this project.</p>

    <h3>Installing and running the IXmaps Client</h3>

    <p>IXmapsClient works on <strong>Windows</strong>, <strong>Mac OS X</strong>, and <strong>Linux</strong>.</p>

        <h5>Windows</h5><a class="dl-btn" href="https://www.ixmaps.ca/IXmapsClient/IXmapsClient.1.1.1.win64.exe">Download</a>
        <div style="clear:both"></div>
        This version of the software runs on Windows 10.
        <ul class="nobullet">
          <li><a href="https://www.ixmaps.ca/IXmapsClient/IXmapsClient.1.1.1.win64.exe">Download the <strong>IXmapsClient</strong> installer IXmapsClient.1.1.1.win64.exe</a></li>
          <li>Double click on <strong>IXmapsClient.1.1.1.win64.exe</strong> and install the application in the directory <strong>C:\IXmapsClient</strong></li>
          <li>Copy the <strong>IXmapsClient-Shortcut</strong> to your Desktop</li>
          <li>In order to allow the <strong>IXmapsClient</strong> to run properly, you may need to authorize <strong>Windows Firewall</strong> to allow inbound connections. For a detailed guide on how to change these settings, see the included README file</li>
          <li>Double click on <strong>IXmapsClient-Shortcut</strong> to launch</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>IXmapsClient</strong> needs to be executed in a terminal with administrator's privileges. For this reason, when double clicking <strong>IXmapsClient-Shortcut</strong>, a new terminal window will be opened asking permission to run the application as an administrator; you may need to enter your admin password to proceed. The <strong>IXmapsClient</strong> interface should appear in your browser, or use your browser to go http://localhost:2040/.</p>

        <strong>Removing IXmapsClient</strong>
        <ul class="nobullet">
          <li>Run <strong>C:\IXmapsClient\unins000.exe</strong> to completely remove <strong>IXmapsClient</strong> from your machine</li>
        </ul>

        <br />

        <h5>Mac OSX</h5><a class="dl-btn" href="https://www.ixmaps.ca/IXmapsClient/IXmapsClient.1.1.1.macos.dmg">Download</a>
        <div style="clear:both"></div>
        <ul class="nobullet">
          <li><a href="https://www.ixmaps.ca/IXmapsClient/IXmapsClient.1.1.1.macos.dmg">Download the <strong>IXmapsClient</strong> installer <strong>IXmapsClient.1.1.1.macos.dmg</strong></a></li>
          <li>Double click on the <strong>IXmapsClient.1.1.1.macos.dmg</strong> to open it</li>
          <li>Drag the <strong>IXmapsClient.app</strong> application to your <strong>Applications</strong> folder</li>
          <li>Double click on <strong>IXmapsClient.app</strong> to launch</li>
        </ul>

        <p>IXmapsClient for macOS is not signed with an Apple Developer ID and macOS <a href="https://support.apple.com/HT202491">Gatekeeper security settings</a> will not allow it to be started. To bypass Gatekeeper one time for IXmapsClient, control-click or right-click on the <strong>IXmapsClient.app</strong> icon and choose <strong>Open</strong> from the context menu.</p>

        <p><strong>If you have upgraded to OSX Catalina, you may experience further challenges getting the IXmapsClient to work correctly on your machine. It has been tested on Catalina and is confirmed to work, but you may need to approve multiple libraries in Settings - Security & Privacy. We are working to resolve this issue, please bear with us!</strong></p>

        <p><strong>IXmapsClient</strong> needs to be executed in a terminal with administrator's privileges. For this reason, make sure to use an Administrator user account instead of a Standard user account when running <strong>IXmapsClient</strong>. When double clicking <strong>IXmapsClient.app</strong>, a new terminal window will be opened asking for the administrator's password; you may need to enter your admin password to proceed. The <strong>IXmapsClient</strong> interface should appear in your browser, or use your browser to go to http://localhost:2040/.</p>

        <strong>Removing IXmapsClient</strong>
        <p>Move the <strong>IXmapsClient.app</strong> application from your <strong>Applications</strong> folder to the Trash. Emptying the trash will completely remove the IXmaps Client from your computer</p>

        <div style="clear:both"></div>
        <ul class="nobullet">
          <li><a href="https://www.ixmaps.ca/IXmapsClient/IXmapsClient.1.1.1.linux.tar.gz">Download the <strong>IXmapsClient</strong> installer <strong>IXmapsClient.1.1.1.linux.tar.gz</strong></a></li>
          <li>Extract the contents of the file <strong>IXmapsClient.1.0.6.linux.tar.gz</strong>, e.g. with the Linux Archive Manager or by running the following command in a terminal window: <strong>tar xzvf IXmapsClient.1.1.1.linux.tar.gz</strong></li>
          <li>Run <strong>./start.sh</strong> in the terminal to launch the application</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>IXmapsClient</strong> needs to be executed in a terminal with administrator's privileges.

    <h3>Correcting the location of routers</h3>
    <p>Locating accurately the individual routers that switch data packets along the way to their destination is challenging. You may find when examining traceroutes displayed on the Map page that some routers appear out of place, sometimes even wildly. We invite you to use the Flag option to point these out and suggest more accurate locations for the IP addresses of such routers so we can correct it later. This can be done by clicking on the routers (dots) or hops (lines), and then the appropriate Flag button. Any information you provide about why you think the router location is inaccurate, and where it is more likely to be, is helpful in making corrections. See our FAQ page for more on geolocation.</p>

    <h3>Improving our software</h3>
    <p>While we do our best to ensure that our software operates reliably and safely, and is easy to use, this is not a polished, high-end application, but rather the latest product of a on-going, unevenly funded research project. If you encounter difficulties or see obvious areas for improvement, please be patient and let us know what needs to be improved. Or better, if you have the skills, make the improvements yourself! The code used for gathering traceroutes, as well as the code for the website and various related components, is free and open source, and available from our GitHub repositories.</p>
    <p>We welcome all feedback (critical and appreciative), technical inquiries or offers for assistance regarding IXmaps software, database, or website. Please email the IXmaps team.</p>
